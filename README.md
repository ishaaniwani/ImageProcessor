# ImageProcessor
A Java program to do cool things to JPG files.

This project has produced a image processing program to explore JPG images in new ways. There are many different thungs you can
do to alter the image, such as mirroring the right side to the left, creating the opposite color version of the image, and even
detect edges. 

This was for a project for the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science.
